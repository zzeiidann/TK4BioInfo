"""
PhyloGene - Python Phylogenetic Analysis Library
Inspired by R's ape and phangorn packages

Features:
- UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)
- Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
- Maximum Likelihood (ML)
- Maximum Parsimony (MP)
- Tree reading/writing (Newick format)
- Tree plotting and visualization
- DNA distance calculations
- Async support for faster computation
